But that's not what this is about. Seeing a movie is fun. But BEING in one, that's a whole pool of anxiety. I'm moving again and this time it really does feel like the season 3 of my chapter is ending but for some reason, it seems like the series might end as well.\n\nAs I left season 2, I was diagnosed, left for myself by anyone I considered a friend. Since then life has changed, people have introduced themselves and left and some friendships became closer. Let's call this the spin-off series or something maybe not worth a main storyline. But as this season finishes, fate has once again thwarted my past in my face. People who I consciously burned a bridge from, people who I needed to distance myself from and people who we mutually separated, and I'm talking about these things happening in a span of 3 days - back to back.\n\nAll put together, why does fate reintroduce season 1 and 2 characters back in my life? It's not them who have reached out, it's that I have seen them; and hence my anxiety.\n\nMaybe this is fate telling me it's time for me to let go. The series might end but it's time for me to write the new script. I'll take what I can get - that's not a problem - and leave behind what I want to - that's the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked at the moon a few days ago. \n\nI saw some peace and I saw some serenity. \n\nI didn't find you there but I did see you. I saw what you did to my life and I saw what you meant to my life. \n\nI guess I saw who I'd become. \n\nI might see you again soon. \n\nBut I wish that it's not me who finds you.\n\n-AG"
