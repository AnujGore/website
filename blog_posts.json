But that's not what this is about. Seeing a movie is fun. But BEING in one, that's a whole pool of anxiety. I'm moving again and this time it really does feel like the season 3 of my chapter is ending but for some reason, it seems like the series might end as well.<br><br>As I left season 2, I was diagnosed, left for myself by anyone I considered a friend. Since then life has changed, people have introduced themselves and left and some friendships became closer. Let's call this the spin-off series or something maybe not worth a main storyline. But as this season finishes, fate has once again thwarted my past in my face. People who I consciously burned a bridge from, people who I needed to distance myself from and people who we mutually separated, and I'm talking about these things happening in a span of 3 days - back to back.<br><br>All put together, why does fate reintroduce season 1 and 2 characters back in my life? It's not them who have reached out, it's that I have seen them; and hence my anxiety.<br><br>Maybe this is fate telling me it's time for me to let go. The series might end but it's time for me to write the new script. I'll take what I can get - that's not a problem - and leave behind what I want to - that's the problem.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I looked at the moon a few days ago. <br><br>I saw some peace and I saw some serenity. <br><br>I didn't find you there but I did see you. I saw what you did to my life and I saw what you meant to my life. <br><br>I guess I saw who I'd become. <br><br>I might see you again soon. <br><br>But I wish that it's not me who finds you.<br><br>-AG"
